# Tawny AV

## Description
Tawny AV is a python based audio visual software to display dynamic visualizations based live audio captured by a microphone. Tawny dynamically triggers effects based on the beat of the audio input in order to create procedural visualizations.


## Installation
1. Ensure the latest version of Python is installed on your system. You can download the latest version of Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

2. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/LeonStansfield/tawnyAV.git
    ```

3. Run the correct program for your operating system. If the virtual environment isnt already created, it will set this up along with the dependencies. EG run_linux_mac.sh or run_windows.bat

## Todo
 - I would like to modify TawnyAV to use GPU based shaders instead of CPU based visuals. This will essentially turn TawnyAV into a audio reactive shader toy - meaning it could support a large range of visuals, similar to those found on www.shadertoy.com
